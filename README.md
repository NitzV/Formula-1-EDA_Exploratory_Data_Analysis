This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Formula 1 racing data. The goal of this project is to uncover interesting trends, driver performance insights, and team dynamics using historical racing statistics.
This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical Formula 1 race data to uncover insights into driver performance, consistency, and circuit-wise dominance. Multiple datasets related to drivers, race results, and circuits were merged, cleaned, and analyzed using Python.

The analysis emphasizes the Top 10 Formula 1 drivers, evaluating their performance across selected global circuits using metrics such as Average Points per Race, Performance Consistency Index (PCI), and circuit-wise average points. Correlation analysis was conducted to study the relationship between qualifying position, fastest lap speed, and race outcomes.

Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, standardizing attributes, and creating derived metrics to support meaningful comparisons. The results were visualized using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, enabling clear interpretation of trends and patterns. Additionally, the project includes a circuit-based performance analysis to highlight drivers who consistently dominate specific tracks worldwide.

This project demonstrates how data science and analytics can be applied to motorsport to transform raw racing data into actionable performance insights.
